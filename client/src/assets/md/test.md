# Where you can get started?
I have severally received this question by students and junior developers; what is front-end, what is back-end, what. I write this article to try and answer some of those questions. I believe knowing the journey you are going to take will help one make better decisions and also take on the course with confidence.

```json
{
    "test":1
}
```

Then there is XML

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```
